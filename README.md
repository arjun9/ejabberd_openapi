# Ejabberd OpenAPI Specification

This repository contains the OpenAPI specification for Ejabberd APIs. The specification allows for the generation of client libraries in various languages using the OpenAPI Generator.

## Using the OpenAPI Specification

With this specification, you can easily generate client libraries for Ejabberd APIs in numerous programming languages. This provides a streamlined way to interact with Ejabberd services without manually crafting HTTP requests.

## Installation of OpenAPI Generator

Before generating client code, you'll need to install the OpenAPI Generator. You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -g
```

Alternatively, you can use the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull openapitools/openapi-generator-cli
```

## Generating Client Libraries

With the OpenAPI Generator installed, you can generate client libraries for various languages. Below are examples for Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript:

### Java

To generate a Java client:

```bash
openapi-generator-cli generate -i path/to/ejabberd-openapi-spec.yml -g java -o /output/directory/java-client
```

### JavaScript

To generate a JavaScript client:

```bash
openapi-generator-cli generate -i path/to/ejabberd-openapi-spec.yml -g javascript -o /output/directory/javascript-client
```

### TypeScript

To generate a TypeScript client:

```bash
openapi-generator-cli generate -i path/to/ejabberd-openapi-spec.yml -g typescript-fetch -o /output/directory/typescript-client
```

Replace `path/to/ejabberd_openapi_spec.yml` with the path to your OpenAPI specification file and `/output/directory/` with your desired output directory.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions to improve the specification. Please submit issues and pull requests, adhering to the provided templates.
